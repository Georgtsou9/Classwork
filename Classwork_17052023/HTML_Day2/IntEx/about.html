    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
        Founded in 2016, CodeFactory Wien follows the concept of programming boot camps of Anglo-American countries. Our goal is to provide time-efficient and very practice-oriented training with the aim of the fastest possible career entry as a junior developer. Our courses are tailored to newcomers, people who want to change careers in the second or third educational path as well as people who are interested in an application-oriented education.
